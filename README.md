| Name       | Contribution |
|------------|--------------|
| **Caroline** | Implemented the UI, publisher, fetching, and modifying features for Firestore data given the userâ€™s selection on data upload and redaction of data for the privacy controls. |
| **Dhruv**    | Wrote centralized privacy module class for management and storage of selected data. Worked collaboratively with Evelyn S. to create an end to end pipeline of chat interface authentication. |
| **Evelyn H.** | Implemented the UI for privacy controls, fetching and updating data in Firestore to reflect user changes in hiding data by timestamp or time range. |
| **Evelyn S.** | Worked collaboratively with Dhruv to create an end to end pipeline of chat interface authentication. The iOS app sends a JWT to the frontend, which then verifies the JWT using Firebase Admin SDK in the backend, and the user can then access the chat view
| **Bryant**   | Implemented client side handling for push notification registration + handling, as well as the backend listener system and scheduling for notifications/schedule changes. Also added testing framework to backend. |
